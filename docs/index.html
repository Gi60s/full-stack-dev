        <div class="post-content"><h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>In this class we will learn how to do full stack development.</p>
<p>As technology continues to evolve at an ever quickening pace it is becoming increasingly more difficult to be a full stack developer.</p>
<p>Through this class we will develop a full stack application, but how much we cover and what will be determined based on what you want to learn and how much we can tackle together.</p>
<h1 id="you-are-qualified">You are Qualified</h1>
<p>We each have different backgrounds, different educations, and different levels of experiences in all aspects of life.</p>
<p>Your range of experiences uniquely qualify you to see solutions that others may not.</p>
<p>You are not an impostor here. You belong.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<p><strong>Client (browser)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>A single page app. Although the look of the screen and the URL may change, it should never load the whole page after the first page load.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use Vue/Nuxt.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Allow the user to provide input to your application.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Content must be catered to the user.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Server</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Write a custom server using NodeJS.</p>
</li>

</li>
<li><p>Must manage user sessions.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Users must be able to provide input and have a dynamic experience.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You can work alone or in groups of two or three people.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you have more people working on the project then more will be expected of your final project.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="project-proposal">Project Proposal</h2>
<p>Within the first few weeks of class we&#39;ll take time to discuss the project you&#39;d like to work on. The purpose of this is two fold:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>To help you create a project that is not too large and not too small.</p>
</li>
<li><p>To answer any questions you have about your project.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="grading-criteria">Grading Criteria</h2>
<p>The grade for your final project is based on a presentation that will occur on one of the last two days of class. There is no extra credit for presenting the first day. If any team fails to present they will receive a 0% on their final project.</p>
<p>The presentation should include a demonstration of the web application as well as some code examples. The following criteria will be used to grade your final project.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Attendance (5%)</strong> - You must be there both days (one day to present, the other to see presentations).</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Database Usage (10%)</strong> - You must have your own database for storing data and your web application should read from and write to that database. (Show some code.)</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>REST API (15%)</strong> - You must have several REST endpoints for sending data to the server and getting data back from the server. (Show some code.)</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Single Page Application (15%)</strong> - You&#39;re application should have the ability to navigate without reloading the page. You need to have at least three views (more if you have a team). (Show through demonstration.)</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Session Management (15%)</strong> - Users must be able to log into your system and remain logged in while navigating the site and during page reloads. Logout must also be available. (Show through demonstration.)</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Polish (5%)</strong> - I don&#39;t expect you to be a UI or UX expert, but I do expect the front end application to make sense and be usable without special instruction. (Show through demonstration.)</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Project Scope (15%)</strong> - Don&#39;t make your project too small. If you have questions about what is too small be sure to ask me. (Show through demonstration.)</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Container Management (15%)</strong> - You application needs to use Docker Compose so that it can be easily run from any computer that has container management capabilities.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Reward and Challenge (5%)</strong> - Share with the class what the most rewarding part of the project was as well as the most challenging.</p>
</li>
