## Introduction

In this class we will learn how to do full stack development.

As technology continues to evolve at an ever quickening pace it is becoming increasingly more difficult to be a full stack developer.

Through this class we will develop a full stack application, but how much we cover and what will be determined based on what you want to learn and how much we can tackle together.

Each class will consist of time spent in instruction followed by time spent for lab work. Lab work is an opportunity to work through assignments in class and to talk through assignments submitted in class.

## You are Qualified

We each have different backgrounds, different educations, and different levels of experiences in all aspects of life.

Your range of experiences uniquely qualify you to see solutions that others may not.

You are not an impostor here. You belong.

## Homework

Homework assignments will be posted to [Learning Suite](https://learningsuite.byu.edu).

Some homework will need to be submitted and some will require an in-class pass off.

Late assignments will loose 5% per class late (not per day late) up to 50%.

Homework assignments will be toward building the semester project and will build one upon another. Don't fall behind. If you need help, please reach out.

## Semester Project

- Throughout the semester you will build a web app of your choosing.
- You should plan on using the homework assignments to build your semester project.
- You will need to present your semester project on the last day of class.

### Requirements

Build a full stack (client and server) web application using [JavaScript](/fundamentals/javascript) and [NodeJS](/nodejs/nodejs-and-npm).

**Client (browser)**

- Using [Nuxt](nuxt.md) and [Vue](/vue/into), built a client side application.
- A single page app. Although the look of the screen and the URL may change, it should never load the whole page after the first page load.
- Allow the user to provide input to your application.
- Content must be catered to the user.
    
**Server**

- Write a [REST API using NodeJS](/fundamentals/rest).
- Use either a [NoSQL](/databases/no-sql) or [SQL](/databases/sql) database (or both).
- Users must be able to create and use a login.
- Must manage user sessions.
- Users must be able to provide input and have a dynamic experience.
- REST API endpoints must be used to get data from the server and to update data on the server.

**Environment**

- Must use docker containers for local development, including it's own containerized database.
- It must provide a way via environment variables or other configuration settings to let your app run in multiple environments. For example, develop locally but deploy to the cloud.

### Alone or with a Group

- You can work alone or in pairs.
- If you have two people working on the project then more will be expected of your semester project. I will also expect and look for an equal amount of contribution from each person.

### Grading Criteria

The grade for your semester project is based on a presentation that will occur on the last day of class. If anyone fails to present they will receive a 0% on their semester project.

The presentation should include the following:

- An explanation of what you built and why you choose to build it.
- A demonstration of the working application.
- What you learned from building the application.

### Example Semester Projects from the Past

- A calendar application that helps multiple users schedule on their own calendars or on a shared calendar.
- A recipe website where recipes can be submitted, categorized, searched by ingredients available, etc.
- A D&D tracking website.
- A puzzle video game.
- A project management application that tracks tasks across users and allows for team communication (posts, comments).
- An app to help manage a church calling.
- A photography application for uploading, categorizing, and searching.
