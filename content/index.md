## Introduction

In this class we will learn how to do full stack development.

As technology continues to evolve at an ever quickening pace it is becoming increasingly more difficult to be a full stack developer.

Through this class we will develop a full stack application, but how much we cover and what will be determined based on what you want to learn and how much we can tackle together.

Each class will consist of time spent in instruction followed by time spent for lab work. Lab work is an opportunity to work through assignments in class and to talk through assignments submitted in class.

## You are Qualified

We each have different backgrounds, different educations, and different levels of experiences in all aspects of life.

Your range of experiences uniquely qualify you to see solutions that others may not.

You are not an impostor here. You belong.

## Homework and the Semester Project

Throughout the semester we will be building a full-stack web application. Homework assignments are based on milestones that need to be reached for you to be successful with your semester project.

Homework assignments will be posted to [Learning Suite](https://learningsuite.byu.edu) and passed off in class.

Late assignments will lose 5% per class late (not per day late) up to 50%.

You get to choose your own semester project.

The semester project is worth 30% of your overall grade.
