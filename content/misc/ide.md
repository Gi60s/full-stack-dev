<question-answer q="What is an IDE">

An IDE is an Integrated Development Environment. It's an app that makes it easier to write, test, and run code.

</question-answer>

For this class we'll be using the [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) IDE.

- It's free.
- It has a lot of extensions.
- It's written in JavaScript.

I also highly recommend the [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) IDE which I believe is just a little better, but is also a paid solution.

## Plugins

Here are some plugins to get started with that will improve the VS Code IDE experience:

- Live Share - Will allow us to write code together in real time.
- Docker - Will help with Docker container and image management.
- Remote Containers - Will help with running code in containers.
- HashiCorp Terraform - Will help to write Terraform code.
- language-stylus - Will help to write Stylus code.
- Vetur - Will help to write Vue code.
